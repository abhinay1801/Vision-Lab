# VisionLab – Virtual Experiment Simulator
---

## Overview
**VisionLab** is a **web-based virtual laboratory** designed to make science experiments **accessible, affordable, and interactive**.
It empowers students — especially in rural areas with limited resources — to perform hands-on experiments online using simulations, videos, animations, and real-time feedback.  
It bridges the educational gap for schools and learners who lack access to lab infrastructure, ensuring that **every student can gain hands-on STEM experience anytime, anywhere**.

**Why VisionLab?**  
- Physical labs are expensive and often unavailable.  
- Experiments can be error-prone and resource-intensive.  
- Students deserve **equal opportunities** to explore science regardless of location.  

VisionLab solves these problems by providing an **immersive, flexible, and scalable** e-learning environment.
